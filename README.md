# Kent-State-Randomizer-Excel
Classic Randomizer Based on Excel

Randomizer is designed to optimize the number of interactions between class participants over the course of a multiple-class semester.
Criteria include minimizing the number of times any two participants are in same group and balancing the number of times any individual
is a group leader.  

Input from users is simply a class list.  Users identify the number of sessions and the number of individuals expected per group. 

This version is written in Excel-VBA.  We have also developed a fully functional version in R-Shiny.
